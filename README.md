# Ride Share

It is a web application to connect with the people to share ride between while passing through the same route.
This repository is created for the websites for sharing the ride. You can refer this repository for creating similiar websites.

Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Please do not fork this repository directly on GitHub. Instead, please use GitHub's importer following the instructions below to
copy this workshop-template repository and customize it for your workshop.

Please do your work in your repository's gh-pages branch, since that is what is automatically published as a website by GitHub.

If you run into problems, or have ideas about how to make this process simpler, please get in touch. The pages on customizing your website, the FAQ, and the design notes have more detail on what we do and why. And please note: if you are teaching Git, please create a separate repository for your learners to practice in.
